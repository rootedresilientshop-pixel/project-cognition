- Clone count

### Expected Numbers

```
Before:  3 downloads, 0 stars, ~5 visitors/month
Week 1:  3 downloads, 0 stars, ~50 visitors

## What You'll Compete With

Other AI VS Code extensions have:
- 10K+ stars (but they launched months/years ago)
- 100K+ downloads (but they have marketing budgets)

**You can realistically reach:**
- 100-500 stars in 6 months
- 500-2000 downloads in 6 months

With consistent engagement and releases.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to promote on all platforms?**
A: No. Pick your favorite 1-3. Quality > quantity.

**Q: How often should I promote?**
A: With each major release (monthly). Don't spam.

**Q: What if no one shows up?**
A: Give it 2-4 weeks. Growth takes time. Keep engaging.

**Q: Should I pay for ads?**
A: Not for open source. Organic growth is better long-term.

**Q: What if someone creates a competing project?**
A: Good! Competition validates the market. Just execute better.
