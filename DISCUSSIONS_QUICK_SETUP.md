## Step 2: Create 4 Discussion Categories

Click **New Discussion** and create these (in order):

### Category 1: Announcements

**Title:** Welcome to Project Cognition! 🚀

**Content:**
```
Hi everyone! 👋

Welcome to the Project Cognition GitHub Discussions. This is where we connect as a community, share ideas, and build the future of AI-assisted development together.

## What is Project Cognition?

Project Cognition solves a real problem: **AI amnesia**. You tell Claude your architectural decision on Day 1, then same day in a different conversation, Claude suggests the opposite. Week later you're debugging a bug Claude "fixed" before.

Project Cognition fixes this by creating a **memory layer stored in your Git repo**. One command injects that memory into Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, or any AI tool.

## Vision

We're building a tool that transforms AI from "amnesia-prone assistant" to "context-aware partner."

## Get Involved

- **Report bugs** - Found a problem? Let us know
- **Suggest features** - What would make Project Cognition better?
- **Share your use case** - How are you using it?
- **Contribute** - Check out CONTRIBUTING.md

## Installation

Install from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DigitalForgeAI.project-cognition)

Thanks for being here! 🙌

### Category 2: General

**Title:** Ask Questions, Share Ideas

**Content:**
```
Welcome to General Discussion! 👋

This is the place to:

## Ask Questions
- "How do I set up Project Cognition for my team?"
- "Does this work with my favorite AI tool?"
- "How often should I update memory files?"

## Share Your Experience
- Tell us about your workflow with Project Cognition
- Share challenges you're facing

## Discuss Features
- "What would make Project Cognition better for you?"
- "How are you using the failure logging feature?"

Be kind, be respectful, help each other learn.

Looking forward to your questions! 🚀
```

### Category 3: Show and Tell

**Title:** Share Your Success Stories

**Content:**
```
We'd love to hear how you're using Project Cognition!

## Share Your Story

Tell us about:
- Your project and what you're building
- How your memory is organized (intent.md, decisions.md)
- Your workflow with Project Cognition
- Success stories and lessons learned

## Example

**Project:** Building a real-time collaboration tool

**Memory highlights:**
- Intent: "Offline-first, real-time sync, zero server"
- Key decision: "Use CRDT for sync"
- Lesson learned: "Event listeners can leak memory"

**Impact:** Prevented Claude from suggesting client-server architecture 5 times. Now stays consistent with our offline-first approach.

Don't worry about being perfect. We want to hear from everyone - side projects to enterprise apps.

Share your story! ⬇️

### Category 4: Ideas & Feedback

**Title:** Help Shape the Future

**Content:**
```
We're actively building Project Cognition based on **your feedback**. This is where great ideas come from.

## What We're Listening For

### Feature Ideas
- "I wish Project Cognition could..."
- "What if we added..."

### Workflow Improvements
- "The current process is clunky because..."
- "It would be faster if..."

### Pain Points
- "I hit a problem when..."
- "This doesn't work well because..."

## Current Roadmap (High Level)

**v0.3.0 (Next)**
- Memory visualization in sidebar
- Better failure log browsing

**v0.4.0**
- Team collaboration
- Shared memory with comments

**v1.0+**
- Native integrations
- AI-powered suggestions

But we're flexible! If your feedback suggests a better direction, we'll listen.

## Examples of Good Feedback

✅ "When I try to log failures, it takes 5 minutes. Could it be faster?"
✅ "I use ChatGPT instead of Claude. Does the memory format work the same?"
✅ "It would be great if Project Cognition suggested decisions based on failures."

Drop your idea! ⬇️
