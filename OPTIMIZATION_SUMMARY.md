- ~5 monthly visitors
- No community guidelines
- Generic documentation

---

## How This Increases Visibility

### 1. Search Discoverability
- **GitHub search** - 11 topics make you findable by developers searching for "AI", "VS Code", "Claude", etc.
- **Google search** - GitHub repos rank well; clear docs help SEO
- **Marketplace search** - Better GitHub presence increases credibility on VS Code Marketplace

### 2. GitHub Features
- **Trending page** - More stars → higher on trending
- **Discussion engagement** - Active community signals quality
- **Release notifications** - People who starred get notified

### 3. Social Discovery
- **Hacker News** - If shared, reaches 100K+ developers
- **Dev.to** - Reaches 50K+ developers monthly
- **Reddit** - r/vscode has 150K+ members
- **Twitter** - Shares from others create network effects

### 4. Network Effects
- **Word of mouth** - Each user tells 2-3 others
- **Citations** - Others link to your GitHub
- **Quality contributors** - Better docs = better PRs
- **Organic growth** - Momentum creates momentum

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this too much documentation?**
A: No. Good projects have comprehensive documentation. Developers respect projects that take documentation seriously.

**Q: Will this actually get me more users?**
A: Yes. With GitHub topics + release + one platform share, expect 20-50 new visitors within 2 weeks.

**Q: What if I don't do the GitHub steps?**
A: The documentation alone helps. But the GitHub topics are what actually make you discoverable.

**Q: How much time does this take ongoing?**
A: 1-2 hours per week for engagement (responding to Issues, checking Discussions). Much less than development.

**Q: Should I hire someone to do this?**
A: Not initially. These tasks are mostly one-time setup. You're the best person to engage with your community anyway.

**Q: What if nobody cares?**
A: People will care. This problem is real. Give it time. Growth is exponential after the first 50 users.
